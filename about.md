# About

The point of this site is to provide high protein, low calorie meals that actually taste good and is easy to make. If you're looking to be in a calorie decifit, the worst thing you want to do is to be completely burnt out because the food you're eating tastes awful. Or you have to make a completely separate meal for yourself vs what the rest of the family eats.  If you have kids, I would recommend you modify some of these meals for them (or add sides) to add a bit more calories but the protein numbers are still solid.

I made this site to keep track of all of the recipes that have worked for me. These are all very easy to make, require common ingredients, and taste pretty good. I've collected and modified a bunch of recipes and wanted a place where I can look back at and re-make stuff I liked.

I'm a husband and dad of young kids. I suck at cooking, love to grill, and like making delicious and healthy meals for my family.  I also like meal prepping because it comes in super handy for busy mornings or when you don't know what to pack your kids for lunch.  

I had some goals when I started doing this:
1. Meals have to be easy (and fast) to make, using common ingredients that can be found at just about any grocery store
2. They have to taste good. I'm not interested in grilled chicken breast and steamed broccoli for every meal and neither is my family.
3. I can't be the guy that eats a different meal than the rest of my family. This just adds burden to everyone, especially your spouse.
4. This has to be sustainable. If I get burnt out after a couple of weeks either because the food sucks or it's too much work, it accomplishes nothing.

Personally I've followed this for a few months and was able to drop 18 pounds. Your results may vary (I also lifted weights and made sure to be somewhat active), but losing and maintaining weight should be dead simple and it kind of is. A calorie deficit *will* result in weight loss.

The reasons why protein is so important:
1. It helps you feeling full. You ever eat a large vegetarian meal and still feel hungry, or get hungry a few minutes later? 
2. When you're losing weight, you want to aim to lose fat, not muscle. But your body will break dowh muscle if you don't get enough protein.
3. It boosts your metabolism. Your body burns more calories burning protein than it does carbs or fat.

There are actually tons more reasons but you get the point. 

If you're a vegetarian, this might not work for you. I'm sure there are lots of vegetarian and vegan-friendly recipes but I know nothing about that. But I do know that beef is extremely nutrient rich.  Just make sure you're getting enough vitamin C and fiber too.
