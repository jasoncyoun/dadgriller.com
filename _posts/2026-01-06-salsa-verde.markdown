One of my favorite salsas is the King Taco/El Taurino green sauce. Apparently the recipe is a secret but I found one on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_t05MCRVg) that's pretty close to it.  I couldn't tell you how many servings this recipe is. It's well over 4 cups though.

### Directions  
1. Peel the outer leaves off the tomatillos if they have them and wash the tomatillos. Cut the stems off the peppers.
2. Roast the tomatillos and peppers on all sides until you get a char.
3. Dice the cilantro and onions.
4. Blend the peppers along with half a cup of water.
5. Add tomatillos to blender and blend.
6. Add your spice mixes and blend more.
7. Put your mix into a large bowl or whatever you're going to use to store everything.
8. Add salt, onions, and cilantro to the mix and stir.
9. Add the bouillon and mix.
10. Put this in the fridge for at least an hour. It doesn't just cool everything down but it affects the taste and mellows out the acidity.

The key here for me was the bouillon powder. It actually does taste pretty close to the King Taco sauce but it's a bit spicier. You can change that with the amount of serrano pepers you use though.
