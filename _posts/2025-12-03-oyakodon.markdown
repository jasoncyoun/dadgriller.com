Oyakodon is one of my favorite Japanese dishes. I didn't realize it's also pretty healthy and packed with protein. It's really simple to make, takes just a few ingredients, and the whole family will enjoy it. There's many ways to make it and you can get as complicated or "authentic" as you want but this way worked for me.

    <li data-base-qty="1.5" data-unit="lbs" data-ingredient-name="Boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch pieces"></li>
    <li data-base-qty="1" data-unit="medium" data-ingredient-name="Onion. Sliced thin."></li>
    <li data-base-qty="0.75" data-unit="cup" data-ingredient-name="Dashi, or chicken broth"></li>

  </ul>

### Directions  
1. Wash and trim the excess fat off the chicken and set aside. 
2. In a large pan/wok, mix dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar
3. Add onions and cook over medium until the onions are soft (should take 5 mins or so)
4. Add the chicken and spread it out evenly
5. Cover the pan and cook over low/medium until the chicken is cooked (should take 7 mins)
6. Slowly drizzle the eggs on top (don't mix it in)
7. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes
8. For each serving, spoon it over 1/2 cup of cooked rice.
9. Optional but I added some green onion and shichimi (Japanese chili pepper powder) because I'm fancy like that.

This is a good one that's pretty hard to mess up and high in protein. You can control the calories and protein level too just with the amount of rice you're eating with it.
