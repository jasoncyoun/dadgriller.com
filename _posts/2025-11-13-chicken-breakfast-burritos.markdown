One thing I find super helpful during the week is to meal plan so that I can have meals ready to eat for myself and my family. I found a recipe for a simple breakfast burrito that is healthy and packed with protein. Also these super simple to make. The hardest part was figuring out how to roll a burrito without it falling apart.  This recipe will result in 8 burritos that you can freeze and pop in the microwave later whenever you need to.

### Directions  
1. Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.  
2. Cook ground chicken until browned, set aside.
3. Either air-fry or sautee potatoes with some oil in pan until lightly browned.  
4. Add onions into pan and sautee until they are soft. Optional: Add bell peppers to pan as well.
5. Whisk eggs in a bowl and add to pan until they are cooked. You can slightly undercook them because this will be microwaved later.
6. Add the chicken back along with cheese and mix thoroughly.
7. Try to equally divide into 8 equal parts and fill each part with each tortilla. Optional: Roll the tortilla into a burrito, and cook over medium heat over a pan to brown them.

This is a super low calorie burrito with a decent amount of protein.  You can have two of them at a time and you're looking at 38 grams of protein for under 500 calories.  
After these cool down, I usually wrap it in foil and throw them in the freezer.  Super convenient. The potatoes will keep you filled too (fun fact: potatoes are the best food in keeping you feeling full).  Feel free to modify with your own version as you see fit!
