This might be my favorite pasta dish to make, regardless of whether it is high-protein or not. It combines meat, cheese, and pasta and is super filling.  You can make a bunch of it and freeze individual portions but in my family it doesn't last long enough to do that.  It's such a simple dish that you can also add hot sauce or modify any of the ingredients and quantities to whatever you like.  The main important things here to keep in mind are the lean ground beef (it's just not the same with chicken or turkey) and the high-protein pasta.

This one is a bit higher in calories compared to what I normally make but still very low considering how much protein is in this.  10 grams of protein per 100 calories is a solid ratio still. Also, the quantities of each ingredient don't really  matter that much. For example, I made mine have extra protein by doubling the ground beef but with like every other dish, it's completely up to you.
