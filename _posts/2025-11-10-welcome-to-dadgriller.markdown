Hello World! Welcome to my blog/recipe site. The point of this website is primarily so that I can save and quickly look up some of my favorite recipes.
As a dad of young kids, I enjoy cooking, grilling, and smoking delicious and healthy meals for my wife and kids.  Over the years I have accumulated, modified, and/or come up with recipes that are kind of in my head or I have to dig around to find where I originally got them.  Plus I really don't like most recipe websites where you have to read a 10-page bio of every recipe and fight the 30 pop-up ads that coming up. It's very distracting when you're cooking and have your hands preoccupied with actually making the meal.

Also, as someone in their mid-40's, I try to eat pretty healthy. I want to be around as long as I can and also be active with myself and my family. The things I focus a lot on are high protein, low sugar, and if I'm cooking for myself and the wife, lower calories.

For the photo you're looking at here, I had an idea one day to make chashu ramen, but instead of ramen to use brisket. Man the brisket was the star of the show here. I am still refining this recipe so I will post it later when ready. Anyway, thanks for coming and there will be more recipes to come!
