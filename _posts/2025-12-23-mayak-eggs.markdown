The reason this is "Mayak" eggs is because Mayak (마약) in Korean is translated to "drugs". It's really addictive. Luckily it's pretty good for you though. Typically you eat this over rice. If you eat it with rice, it's not the best for the protein-to-calorie ratio (goal of 10% or higher), but it's fine and still worth it to make these.

### Directions  
1. Boil eggs. You don't want to overdo it so just add your eggs to boiling water for 7 minutes.
2. Put eggs in ice bath and peel once cool
3. Grab your tupperware that you're going to store the eggs in and add the marinade ingredients and mix.
4. Put your eggs in the tupperware. Hopefully they are fully submerged but you can adjust the marinade quantity if needed.
5. Leave in your fridge at least overnight.
6. Serve 2 eggs over half a cup of rice and some marinade.

It's really the rice that offsets that protein to calorie ratio.  Each egg will add about 70 calories and 6 grams of protein so adding another egg here does help add more protein.
