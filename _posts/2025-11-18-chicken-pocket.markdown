This is by far the thing that I hate making the most, but at the same time one of my favorite things to eat.  It's super messy to make and can be really frustrating and make you wonder if it's worth it.  It doesn't have much ingredients so it's simple in that sense, but it's still tricky.  These pockets have a great mixture of toastiness from the bread and savory taste from the chicken and cheese.  I would just suggest that you lay down a bunch of flour on your work surface and also get flour on your hands, otherwise it will get super sticky and difficult to handle.

### Directions  
1. Make the dough. Get a large bowl and mix the flour and greek yogurt until it forms a soft dough. I found that using my hands works the best but it will get messy.
2. Divide this into 6 equal pieces (or the number of servings you want) and set aside.
3. Heat some oil in pan. Cook chicken until browned.
4. Add seasonings and cheese and turn off heat and mix.
5. Roll each piece of dough into a ball and flatten it. I prefer to use my hands (coat your hands with some flour first so it doesn't stick)
6. Place filling in the center of the dough.  Equally divide the filling so that you put a serving's worth of filling in there. Fold and seal edges, then press down with your hand to flatten it a bit.  Don't worry if the dough doesn't fully encompass the fillings. 
7. Heat oil in pan and place your pocket in it until browned/toasted. Then flip it and do the same.
8. If freezing, make sure you wait until it is fully cooled, or else it will steam up in the foil and make the dough mushy.

This is really great for packing an on-the-go lunch or if you just have a few minutes to eat something.  You can add hot sauce if you want too.  I really hate making this, but I've made it 3 times already so that tells you how good it is.  The greek yogurt just helps add a ton of lean protein and this will keep you feeling pretty full.
