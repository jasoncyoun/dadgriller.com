I got this one from [Calwillcookit](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPhdttliDv8/) on Instagram. He does really good recipes but this one is maybe the best tasting and the best on macros of everything I've made so far. The key here is shrimp, which is in the highest tier of foods for the protein-to-calorie ratio. I just changed the amounts of food to feed a family of 4. I also tweaked the recipe a bit to make it easier.

### Directions  
1. Peel and devein the shrimp if you haven't yet
2. Dice the ingredients for the salsa. You can either mix it all together or keep them separate so people can add as much of each that they want. We have young kids that can't eat peppers or onions so we just kept it separated.
3. Combine all of the ingredients for the sauce in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Salt ot taste. If it's too thick for your liking, add a tbsp of water at a time and mix.
4. Mix the ingredients for the shrimp in a bowl and then cook on medium heat. Make sure to flip the shrimp to cook both sides. The way to know it's done is if it curls into a "C" shape. If it curls beyond that, it's overcooked and gets tough and chewy.
5. Serve over rice. Shrimp, then salsa on top, and drizzle with as much lime sauce as you want.

### Macros (for each serving, assuming about 9 shrimp per serving)
Calories: **315 kcal**  
Protein: **50 g**  
Carbohydrates: **39 g**  
Fat: **9 g**

This breaks the 1-to-10 protein-to-calorie ratio, and the fact that it tastes so good is a huge win. The macros here are assuming 2 tbsp's of the sauce but it's only 30 calories per tbsp so go wild with it if you want. You can make it even healthier by using less rice and you might even like it better that way. I felt like there were so many ingredients in here that even 1/4 cup of rice was enough.
