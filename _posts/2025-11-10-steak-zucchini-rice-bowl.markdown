One of my son's favorite restaurants to eat at is Bennihanna. For obvious reasons, we only go there on special occassions.  I'm sure the show that the chef puts on is entertaining for him, but he's really more into the food there and I can't say I blame him. It's hard to mess up steak, butter, and fried rice and it's pretty consistent. I have here a healthier alternative to this recipe.  It's not exactly Bennihanna, or anything like it at all actually but it's still a good meal. Feel free to change it up and add butter and whatever else you want to make it closer to the original or your own style, but my version here is based on a goal to meet specific macros.

For my seasoning, I went to my favorite <a href="https://www.kinders.com/products/the-blend-seasoning?Title=Default+Title">Kinder's The Blend</a>, but you can just use salt, pepper, and garlic powder too.

### Directions  
1. Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.  
2. Sear your cut up steak for a couple of minutes until browned, then set aside.  
3. In the same pan, sauté diced onion + cut zucchini for 3–4 minutes until tender-crisp.  
4. Add soy sauce and seasonings. Toss everything together.  
5. Return steak to the pan and mix thoroughly.  
6. Enjoy with half a cup of cooked white rice. 
7. (Optional): Drizzle your hot sauce on top if you like.

Pretty much a protein bomb considering how little calories there are. If you're really looking to cut calories, you can use a leaner cut of beef than I did, or substitute the white rice with brown rice, wild rice, quinoa, etc.

Also feel free to experiment and change things around. Sometimes I like to grill my steak on the charcoal grill outside before bringing it in and cutting it.  Sometimes I like to season everything before cooking. It's totally up to your preference.
