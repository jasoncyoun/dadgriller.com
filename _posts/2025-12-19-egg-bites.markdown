One thing I like to get at Starbucks is those bacon egg bites. Problem is they're like 6 bucks for 2 and they're 300 calories at 19 grams of protein. Here's a way you can make them at home. Also you can freeze it and microwave them for a quick and high protein breakfast.  Mine has chicken instead of bacon because that's what I had (leftover rotisserie chicken), and it's way higher in protein and lower in calories.

### Directions  
1. Grab a food processor or blendor and add the eggs, egg whites, and cottage cheese and blend until smooth.
2. Get your mold to cook everything in. I used these small silicon molds

 but if I could do it again, I'd use a larger cupcake one. Also these are much easier to clean than the metal ones, but tricky to carry since it folds. So what I did was slide it on a cutting board and then carefully pulled it into the oven later.
3. Add the chicken, bell peppers, and the turkey pepperoni.
4. Add the egg mix in each cavity evenly.
5. Bake at 325 degrees for 25 minutes.

The protein/calorie ratio here is what sets it apart. Plus it tastes pretty good. A high-protein breakfast for the week that you don't have to think about.
